      description: |
        - Sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/join).
        - Email me the name of your Github account.
        - Create a **New Repository** and name it however you'd like ([some tips here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#repository)).
        - Create a new README.md file. Write anything you like, but do it in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics)
        - Note: This repo will be **public**. As soon as you email me the name of your Github account, I'll set you up with a private repo, to which you can post homework assignments. Don't post homework assignments to your **public** repo (unless you want to, in which case, bravo).

    - title: Critique a piece of data journalism
      description: |
        Find a story that purports to use data, read it, and answer the following questions:

        - What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
        - What is the "birth story" of the data, e.g. how were they created in the first place?
        - What claims does the story make based on the data?
        - What are the limitations of the data?
        - Can you find where this (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs.
        Write this memo in Markdown format and post it to your __private__ Github repo. If this hasn't been set up for you, then just email it to me.

        Here are examples of data-based stories that you can use for this assignment if you don't want to look for your own:

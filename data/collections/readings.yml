    - name: Precision Journalism
      author: Philip Meyer
      url: http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/book/
      excerpt: |
        If you are a journalist or are thinking of becoming one, you may have already noticed this: They are raising the ante on what it takes to be a journalist. There was a time when all you needed was dedication to truth, plenty of energy, and some talent for writing. You still need those things, but they are no longer sufficient. The world has become so complicated, the growth of available information so explosive, that the journalist needs to be a filter, as well as a transmitter; an organizer and interpreter, as well as one who gathers and delivers facts.

    - name: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
      url: http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi
      excerpt: |
        For many people the first word that comes to mind when they think about statistical charts is "lie." No doubt some graphics do distort the underlying data, making it hard for the viewer to learn the truth. But data graphics are no different from words in this regard, for any means of communication can be used to decieve.

    - name: Computational Journalism
      url: http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/10/131400-computational-journalism/fulltext
      author: "Sarah Cohen, James T. Hamilton, Fred Turner"
      excerpt: |
        Researchers and journalists are exploring new methods, sources, and ways of linking communities to the information they need to govern themselves. A new field is emerging to promote the process: computational journalism. Broadly defined, it can involve changing how stories are discovered, presented, aggregated, monetized, and archived.

    - name: How to Lie with Statistics
      url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics
      author: Darrell Huff
      excerpt: |
        This book is a sort of primer in ways to use statistics to deceive. It may seem altogether too much like a manual for swindlers. Perhaps I can justify it in the manner of the retired burglar whose published reminiscences amounted to a graduate course in how to pick a lock and muffle a footfall: The crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.

    - name: "The Data Journalism Handbook"
      url: http://datajournalismhandbook.org/
      excerpt: |
         Using data the job of journalists shifts its main focus from being the first ones to report to being the ones telling us what a certain development might actually mean. The range of topics can be far and wide. The next financial crisis that is in the making. The economics behind the products we use. The misuse of funds or political blunders, presented in a compelling data visualization that leaves little room to argue with it.

    - name: The Art and Science of Data-Driven Journalism
      url: http://towcenter.org/blog/the-art-and-science-of-data-driven-journalism/
      excerpt: |
        If reporting does become more scientific over time, it could benefit readers and society as a whole. A managing editor might float an assertion or hypothesis about what lies behind news, and then assign an investigative journalist to go find out whether it’s true or not. That reporter (or data editor) then must go collect data, evidence, and knowledge about it.

    - name: "Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight"
      author: John Foreman
      url: http://www.john-foreman.com/data-smart-book.html
      excerpt: |
        The truth is most people are going about data science all wrong. They're starting with buying the tools and hiring the consultants. They're spending all their money before they even know what they want , because a purchase order seems to pass for actual progress in many companies these days.

    - name: "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets"
      author: David Simon
      description: |
        This is not a work of data journalism, per se, but David Simon's year of embedding himself in the Baltimore homicide squad is a revealing look at all the human and political factors that can skew a number as seemingly final and immutable as the count of a city's homicides.
      excerpt: |
        ...Supervisors in the homicide unit regard the white rectangle as an instrument necessary to assure accountability and clerical precision...The board reveals all: Upon its acetate is writ the story of past and present. Who has grown fat on domestic murders witnessed by half a dozen family members; who has starved on a drug assassination in a vacant rowhouse. Who has reaped the bountiful harvest of a murder-suicide complete with a posthumous note of confession; who has tasted the bitter fruit of an unidentified victim, bound and gagged in the trunk of an airport rental car.

      description: "This 2013 Pulitzer Public Service winning story epitomizes the best of watchdog journalism, as its expose of a deadly public injustice sparked swift reform. But it deserves an award for its ingenious do-it-yourself way of collecting the kind of data that, in theory, was non-existent."

        How exactly do you define "worst"? Here's a high-level description of the factors reporters used to rank the performance of charity, and the amount of data they had to sift and analyze to do so.

        Daniel Gilbert had spreadsheets with thousands of rows of data. "There was a story there, he was certain. But control-f would not find it." After he took a class on how to use Microsoft Access, he could finally ask and answer the questions he knew were in the data. Gilbert's meticulously detailed series on landowners being cheated by oil and gas companies ended up winning a Pulitzer.

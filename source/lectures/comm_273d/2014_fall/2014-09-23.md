### Let's watch a video

> HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- A city of Miami police officer was caught driving 120 mph and a Florida Highway Patrol trooper followed him for several minutes before issuing him a ticket, said FHP.

### Public affairs reporting?

Is this a story in the public interest? What is the news value?

### Data journalism?

##### What are the data points we can find just from this video?

- The time that the officer began the chase
- The location (geocoordinates) the officer when the chase began
- The time that the suspect finally pulled over
- The location of the stop
- the license plate of the driver
- the age of the driver
- the maximum speed clocked by the arresting officer
- the duration of the stop
- the result of the stop (arrest, citation, nothing)
- the jurisdiction of the arresting officer
- the jurisdiction of the arrested officer


##### What other data points might exist?

At the end of the newsclip, the state trooper says:

> This is not...this is not a first time occurrence with y'all. Y'all come from that way all the time...this Miami Police car...and we never catch it!

Clearly, sightings of this speeding cop car have happened before. So maybe there are past instances when this car and/or this particular driver have been stopped.

##### What useful data most likely *doesn't* exist?

On the other hand, the arrested Miami officer is *surprised* &ndash; *"I didn't know you were stopping me, officer!"* &ndash; which indicates that whether or not he sped in the past, being arrested (as a cop, at least) for speeding is a first-time occurrence to him.

We might assume that police officers don't often pull each other over, no matter the speed. If this is the case, then official documentation that Florida cops are speeding needlessly (and *illegally*) may *not exist*.

What then?

### Look to the past

Speeding laws exist for a reason, ostensibly to prevent high-speed accidents.  So if police have been frequently speeding, it's possible that over a span of years, they've had their share of unfortunate accidents.

This is one of the data sources the Sun-Sentinel used in their investigation. Here's an early graf from their first story, "For cops, no limit":

> Speeding cops can kill. Since 2004, Florida officers exceeding the speed limit have caused at least 320 crashes and 19 deaths. Only one officer went to jail — for 60 days.

The third part in their series, [Ruined lives](http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2013/public-service/03day2.pdf), focuses on the victims, both police and bystanders:

##### Is a history of past tragic incidents enough "data"?

Over the span of 8 years, does fewer than 20 officer-involved fatal crashes indicate a trend? It would require at least a comparison against the _total_ number of Floridian fatal crashes in 8 years. But even that may not be a direct enough of a comparison. We would have to know under what conditions and circumstances these 19 accidents took place, as not all of them involved off-duty officers. Given the emergency-related responsibilities of police officers, the conditions under which they drive may be different than for the average citizen.

Over an eight-year time span, 19 deaths and 320 crashes may not *seem* like a lot, especially if the incidents are spread out over various Florida law enforcement agencies, and if no one is keeping track.


### What is the indirect data?

With no direct evidence, the [Sun-Sentinel reporters turned to _indirect_ evidence](http://www.ire.org/blog/ire-news/2013/04/15/how-sun-sentinel-reported-its-pulitzer-prize-winni/), from which, with a little math, would strongly suggest that at least a few police officers were frequently breaking the law as well as their departments' internal regulations:

> Video of the trooper chasing and eventually handcuffing the uniformed officer went viral, and the stories drew hundreds of comments. We suspected plenty of other cops were routinely speeding, but how could we document it?

> We considered GPS devices in police cruisers, but too few agencies used the technology, and those that did immediately put up a fight about releasing the data.

> Then it dawned on us: Florida’s toll system, SunPass, records the date, location and time down to the hundredth of a second when a car passes through a toll booth. If we got those records for police vehicles, we could calculate their speed based on the distance and time it took to go from one toll location to the next.

> SunPass officials initially told us the data was not public, but ultimately agreed with our position and released 1.1 million toll transactions for 3,900 South Florida police transponders. Three months and many miles later, we published the results of our investigation (“Above the Law,” sunsentinel.com/speedingcops).

> Nearly 800 officers from a dozen police agencies drove from 90 to 130 mph during the previous year, often while off-duty and commuting to or from work. Most did not appear to be fighting crime – they were city cops outside their jurisdictions.

For the Miami cop Fausto Lopez caught by the trooper, the SunPass data was especially damning (note what happens to his driving after his arrest):

### Learn to count

via Atul Gawande, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance (p. 254):

> MY THIRD ANSWER for becoming a positive deviant: Count something. Regardless of what one ultimately does in medicine—or outside medicine, for that matter—one should be a scientist in this world. In the simplest terms, this means one should count something...
> 
> When I was a resident I began counting how often our surgical patients ended up with an instrument or sponge forgotten inside them. It didn’t happen often: about one in fifteen thousand operations, I discovered. But when it did, serious injury could result. One patient had a thirteen-inch retractor left in him that tore into his bowel and bladder. Another had a small sponge left in his brain that caused an abscess and a permanent seizure disorder. Then I counted how often such mistakes occurred because the nurses hadn’t counted all the sponges as they were supposed to or because the doctors had ignored nurses’ warnings that an item was missing. It turned out to be hardly ever.

> The numbers began to make sense. If nurses have to track fifty sponges and a couple of hundred instruments during an operation – already a tricky thing to do –it is understandably much harder under urgent circumstances or when unexpected changes require bringing in lots more equipment.

> Our usual approach of punishing people for failures wasn’t going to eliminate the problem, I realized. Only a technological solu  tion would—and I soon found myself working with some colleagues to come up with a device that could automate the tracking of sponges and instruments.

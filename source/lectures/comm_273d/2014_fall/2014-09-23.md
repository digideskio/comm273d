> HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- A city of Miami police officer was caught driving 120 mph and a Florida Highway Patrol trooper followed him for several minutes before issuing him a ticket, said FHP.

### Public affairs reporting?

Is this a story in the public interest? What is the news value?

### Data journalism?

- What are the data points we can find just from this video?

- What other data points must exist?

- What useful data most likely *doesn't* exist?

### Look to the past

When else has this happened?

Is a history of past tragic incidents enough "data"?



### What is the related data?

### What is the impact of data journalism

Incidentally, this story isn't over:

### Learn to count

via Atul Gawande, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance (p. 254):

> MY THIRD ANSWER for becoming a positive deviant: Count something. Regardless of what one ultimately does in medicine—or outside medicine, for that matter—one should be a scientist in this world. In the simplest terms, this means one should count something...
> 
> When I was a resident I began counting how often our surgical patients ended up with an instrument or sponge forgotten inside them. It didn’t happen often: about one in fifteen thousand operations, I discovered. But when it did, serious injury could result. One patient had a thirteen-inch retractor left in him that tore into his bowel and bladder. Another had a small sponge left in his brain that caused an abscess and a permanent seizure disorder. Then I counted how often such mistakes occurred because the nurses hadn’t counted all the sponges as they were supposed to or because the doctors had ignored nurses’ warnings that an item was missing. It turned out to be hardly ever.

> The numbers began to make sense. If nurses have to track fifty sponges and a couple of hundred instruments during an operation – already a tricky thing to do –it is understandably much harder under urgent circumstances or when unexpected changes require bringing in lots more equipment.

> Our usual approach of punishing people for failures wasn’t going to eliminate the problem, I realized. Only a technological solu  tion would—and I soon found myself working with some colleagues to come up with a device that could automate the tracking of sponges and instruments.

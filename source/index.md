This is the class homepage for [Stanford COMM 273D](/lectures/comm_273d/2014_fall), Public Affairs Data Journalism I, as taught in Fall 2014 by [Lecturer Dan Nguyen](http://stanford.edu/~dun). The lessons and tutorials here are available for public use.

## Core concepts

To argue with and against data.

Our focus is not on tools, but concepts and problem solving. Not on complex statistics, but mathematical logic. Not on visualization design but on story-telling.

And above all, a focus on the natural footwork and research needed to both understand data, where it comes from, what stories are behind it, and also when necessary, to dismiss it.


### A conceptual final

Reporting is difficult to teach. The intiution of a story, the doggedness of questioning, is hard to instill no matter what the course. If I had to give a final of 


## Techniques and tools

It's one thing to understand and appreciate the potential data, it's another to directly work with it to test your ideas and satisfy your curiousity. So just as a photography course would expect you to shoot your own photos, this course will teach you how to manage and explore data yourself.

I've tried to keep the tools and programs as agnostic as possible:

- A plain text editor
- A spreadsheet
- A database
- OpenRefine - this is the most specific, narrow-use tool on this list. But it's the best at what it does &ndash; data cleaning &ndash; a field of pursuit that can easily make or break a project.


### A technical final

- Given the line-by-line item list of military surplus items, and the military file for weapon categories, the Census list of FIPS codes, Census demographic data per county:
  -  Clean the data sets so that they can be imported and joined in a relational database
  -  Find the county with the most Humvees per capita
  -  Find all counties that haven't received any military surplus since 2006.

- Given a generic spreadsheet containing a list of data from Twitter profile accounts, such as username, number of followers, number of tweets, most recent tweet, etc..
-  Devise an effective system for flagging spam-like accounts (yes, by just using spreadsheet functions).
- Given a database of those Twitter profile data, and 100 of each account's most recent tweets, write a query that would further refine the accuracy of that spam test.


Note: There won't actually be a final (unless students want one), but this is the level of understanding I hope they reach, so that they can confidently work through data.


### Project work

This class will have regular assignments, such as writing "data memos" and practicing data exploration techniques. The majority of the grade will be based on a data journalism project. 

A fine example can be found at FiveThirtyEight, where Allison McCann manually researched and compiled a database of NFL suspensions, to give context to the NFL's decision-making regarding Ray Rice. Even though McCann didn't have direct access to league officials, and lacked the sourcing of TMZ, her research still brought important context to a hot topic. The incident data itself wasn't complete, but she did the research to know why that was so, and the implications of that.

This would be an easy A for this class. In the end, I don't care what tools you used, how many SQL joins you used, how long you spent cleaning text with regular expressions, or how many charts are used, if any at all: if you can find an untold story, carry it out with context, bring the initiative and curiousity and attention to fact and tell me something I didn't know before, and show why it means something, then you've satisfied the core of journalism.

(But in all these things, a spreadsheet will help. Seriously. Don't *not* use a spreadsheet)



### Related classes

COMM 273D is the pre-requisite for [COMM 274D: Public Affairs Data Journalism II](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=COMM+274D&collapse=), which is taught in the winter by [Cheryl Phillips](http://journalism.stanford.edu/news-cheryl-phillips/).

I am also teaching the following two classes (open to undergraduates outside of the journalism program):

- [COMM 113/213: Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=COMM+213+Civic+Sphere&collapse=) in the winter quarter
- [COMM 177A/277A: Computational Journalism](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=COMM+277A&collapse=) in the spring quarter.

How I see the relationship between the 3 courses I'm teaching: 

- __Public Affairs Data Journalism I__ covers the work and process of journalism, as well as the tools and concepts needed to efficiently understand data &ndash; data, that for the most part, I will have extracted and cleaned for class use. 
- __Computational Methods__ covers the problem-solving skills needed to collect and explore data for public accountability stories, as well as additional techniques for visualizing and publishing data journalism.
-  __Computational Journalism__ focuses on using computational methods and problem-solving to produce a civically-important project, whether a web news application or through other mediums.
